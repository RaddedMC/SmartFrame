# RaddedMC's SmartFrame

## Welcome to the official SmartFrame project repository! This program is designed to grab your favourite data from all over the internet (weather, Smarthome/IoT, Spotify, Chromecast, etc) and display it in a neatly formatted image.

You can use SmartFrame to send data to displays like a [digital photo frame](https://youtu.be/YDr95xaEsK4), and any other internet-connected device with a display that is capable of running Python.
See it in action [here!](https://youtu.be/uRSf9xuUPog)

Please note that while this project is functional, it is still a work in progress. More features and plugins are being worked on daily!

**If you are interested in making a plugin,** check out the [plugin development](https://github.com/RaddedMC/SmartFrame/wiki/Plugin-development) wiki page. If you find any bugs, have suggested changes, or developed a plugin, feel free to make a pull request or contact us via any of the methods listed below.
