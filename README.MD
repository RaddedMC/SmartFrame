# RaddedMC's SmartFrame

## Welcome to the official SmartFrame project repository! This program is designed to grab your favourite data from all over the internet (weather, Smarthome/IoT, Spotify, Chromecast, etc) and display it in a neatly formatted image.

You can use SmartFrame to send data to displays like a [digital photo frame](https://youtu.be/YDr95xaEsK4), and any other internet-connected device with a display that is capable of running Python.

Please note that while this project is functional, it is still a work in progress. More features and plugins are being worked on daily!

**IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN MAKING A PLUGIN,** scroll to the bottom of this readme for more information. If you find any bugs, have suggested changes, or developed a plugin, feel free to make a pull request or contact me via any of the methods listed below.
