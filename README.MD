# RaddedMC's SmartFrame

--- This is still a work in progress, not ready for use yet!! ---

Welcome to my SmartFrame V2 repo! This program is designed to grab your favourite data all over the internet and display it in a neatly formatted image. 
You can use SmartFrame to send data to displays like a digital photo frame (link video), your phone (link iOS shortcut tutorial), or other infoboard-type devices. 

Dependencies (can be installed with pip install): 
--- Pillow: The image library used to draw your data! 
--- termcolor: Used for fancy logging colours 
--- pandas: Used in GenerateImage to keep track of what cards are where during debugging 
--- console-menu: Used to create config files

Known bugs:
--- Occasionally a card will be placed lower down even if there is space for it.
