# RaddedMC's SmartFrame

Welcome to my SmartFrame V2 repo! This program is designed to grab your favourite data all over the internet and display it in a neatly formatted image.
You can use SmartFrame to send data to displays like a digital photo frame (link video), your phone (link iOS shortcut tutorial), or other infoboard-type devices.

Dependencies (can be installed with pip install):
--- Pillow: The image library used to draw your data!
--- termcolor: Used for fancy logging colours
--- pandas: Used in GenerateImage to keep track of what cards are where during debugging

User editable files: 
-- Fonts/font1.ttf < used in main ui
